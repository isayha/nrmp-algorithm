Following the pseudocode format used in the textbook...

m = Hospital
M = Set of all Hospitals
n = Student
N = Set of all Students
S = Solution set (set of all hospital-student matches)

All m are within M and all n are within N

Initially all m and n are unmatched; S is empty

While there remains a hospital m with at least one (1) slot available that has not yet provided an offer to each student n within N
    Choose such a hospital m
    While m has at least one (1) slot available
        Let n be the highest-rank student in m's preference list to whom m has not yet provided an offer
        If n is unmatched then
            m and n become matched -> (m, n) is added to solution set S
        Else if n is currently matched to some other hospital m' then
            If n prefers m to m' then
                m and n become matched -> (m, n) is added to solution set S
                m' and n become unmatched -> (m', n) is removed from solution set S
            Endif
        Endif
    Endwhile
Endwhile
Return S
