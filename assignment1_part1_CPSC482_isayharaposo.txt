Following the pseudocode format used in the textbook...

m = Hospital
M = Set of all Hospitals
n = Student
N = Set of all Students
S = Solution set (set of all hospital-student matches)

Initially all m within M and n within N are unmatched

While there remains a hospital m with at least one free slot that has not yet provided an offer to each student n within N
    Choose such a hospital m
    Let n be the highest-rank student in m's preference list to whom m has not yet provided an offer
    If n is unmatched then
        m and n become matched -> (m, n) is added to solution set S
    Else if n is currently matched to some other hospital m' then
        If n prefers m to m' then
            m and n become matched -> (m, n)
        Else
            continue to next loop interation
        Endif
    Endif
Endwhile
Return S
